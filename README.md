 Project - *CrowdSocial*

**CrowdSocial** is an Android app that allows people to pool in money to participate in a social event.

Example:

If I have a ping pong table at home, I can create a competition event on this app and invite friends or people in nearby locality to participate/play in my event by asking them to contribute a certain amount e.g.: $20 with riders that explain the competition rules, maximum number or participants allowed and how the prize money will be divided amongst the winners. If I create an event with participation amount of $20 and If 10 people agree to participate, the total prize will grow to $200. More the people, larger the prize money.
After the event is over, the event page will display the competition results and the ownerâ€™s name(if not kept private).
